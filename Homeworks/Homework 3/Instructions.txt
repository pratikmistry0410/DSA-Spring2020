Q1:
1. Please execute Q1.py file in Q1 folder for creating 2-3 Red-Black BST and printing the nodes by inorder traversal.
2.I have created tree and printed output for two inputs:
	a. Hard Coded Array: SEARCHEXAMPLE as in the slides. Uncomment main_input1() for using this dataset in the Main Function
	b. Given dataset file i.e. select-data.txt. Uncomment main_input2() for using the given dataset in the Main Function



Q2:
I have calculated average path length for two types of trees: Binary Search Tree as well as 2-3 Red-Black BST and written program each for inserting elements in Ordered and Random format

A. Binary Search Tree
1. Use Q2_BST.py file in Q2 folder for calculating average path lengths of different tree sizes for both random and ordered insertion of keys.

B. 2-3 Red-Black BST
1. Use Q2_RB_BST.py file in Q2 folder for calculating average path lengths of different tree sizes for both random and ordered insertion of keys.



Q3:
1. Please execute Q3.py file in Q3 folder to find the average percentage of red nodes in 2-3 Red-Black BST for different tree sizes
2. Took almost 5 hours for the machine for complete execution



Q4:
Use Q4.py file in Q4 folder for execution. Calculating Average path length and standard deviation for tree sizes 1 to 10000 with 1000 trials will take a lot of time. Thus, I have created two functions: one will execute for all the tree sizes 1 to 10000 and other will execute for selected sizes i.e 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192,10000

A. All nodes: 
1. Uncomment main_allNodes() function in main Function for considering nodes 1 to 10000
2. It took 40 hrs on my machine to execute from node 1 to 2105 after which I had to go for selected node sizes

B. Selected Nodes:
1. Uncomment main_selectedNodes() function in main Function for considering selected nodes
2. It took 45-60 mins on my machine to execute for selected nodes



Q5:
Please execute Q5.py file in Q5 folder for getting the output of select(7) and rank(7)
